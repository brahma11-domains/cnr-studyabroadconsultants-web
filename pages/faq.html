      <div class="faq-list" style="max-width:860px;">

        <h3 style="margin:0 0 20px;font-size:1.1rem;color:var(--gold);">Getting Started</h3>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-q">When should I start my study abroad application? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
          <div class="faq-a">Ideally 12–18 months before your intended intake. For September/October intake, begin by October the year before. Starting early gives you time for test prep, SOP drafting, shortlisting, and visa filing without pressure.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-q">Is the initial consultation with CNR free? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
          <div class="faq-a">Yes, completely. Your first counselling session is free with no obligation. We assess your profile, explain your options, and give you honest feedback — before any engagement begins.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-q">Can CNR help me if I have a gap year in my academics? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
          <div class="faq-a">Yes. Many universities abroad are gap-year friendly, provided the gap is explained with valid reasons (health, work experience, family). We advise you on how to address gaps in your SOP and which universities are more receptive.</div>
        </div>

        <h3 style="margin:36px 0 20px;font-size:1.1rem;color:var(--gold);">English Tests & Eligibility</h3>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-q">Do I need IELTS / TOEFL to study abroad? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
          <div class="faq-a">Most English-taught programs require IELTS (typically 6.0–7.0) or TOEFL. Some universities accept Duolingo or offer conditional admissions to students who need to complete a pre-sessional English course. We help you identify the right test and score target.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-q">Is GRE/GMAT required for MS programs? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
          <div class="faq-a">It depends on the university and country. Many UK and Canadian universities have made GRE optional or waived it. US universities still commonly require GRE for MS programs. We advise based on your specific shortlist and whether GRE will strengthen your profile.</div>
        </div>

        <h3 style="margin:36px 0 20px;font-size:1.1rem;color:var(--gold);">Costs & Finance</h3>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-q">How much does it cost to study abroad? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
          <div class="faq-a">Costs vary significantly by country and course. A 1-year UK PG program typically costs ₹15–30L in tuition; a 2-year US MS can be ₹25–55L. Canada and Australia often offer more affordable options. We give you a full cost breakdown (tuition + living) during counselling.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-q">Are scholarships available for Indian students? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
          <div class="faq-a">Yes. Many universities offer merit-based scholarships, and there are government and external scholarship programs (Chevening, Commonwealth, Inlaks, PFIS, etc.). We help you identify and apply for scholarships that suit your profile.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-q">Can I get an education loan for studying abroad? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
          <div class="faq-a">Yes, education loans for overseas studies are available through major Indian banks (SBI, HDFC Credila, Axis, etc.) and NBFCs. We guide you on what documents are typically required and how to approach lenders — though we are not loan agents.</div>
        </div>

        <h3 style="margin:36px 0 20px;font-size:1.1rem;color:var(--gold);">Work & Visa</h3>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-q">Can I work while studying abroad? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
          <div class="faq-a">Yes, in most destinations. UK, Canada, and Australia allow up to 20 hours/week of work during term time. USA allows on-campus work and CPT/OPT (specific conditions apply). We brief you on the rules applicable to your specific visa and destination.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-q">What are my options to stay and work after graduation? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
          <div class="faq-a">Each country has a post-study work visa: UK Graduate Route (2–3 years), Canada PGWP (up to 3 years), Australia 485 Visa (2–4 years), and USA OPT/STEM-OPT (up to 3 years). These visas allow you to gain professional experience before applying for permanent residency.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-q">What is the student visa rejection rate and how do you prevent it? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
          <div class="faq-a">Rejections are typically due to weak financial documentation, inconsistent SOP, or genuine temporary entrant concerns. Our visa preparation process addresses all these systematically — document checklist, financial planning advice, and interview prep — to give you the strongest possible application.</div>
